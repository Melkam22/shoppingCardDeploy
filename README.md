# React + Vite

It is a shopping cart with React and Vite. You can see the code in [GitHub](https://github.com/Melkam22/shoppingCardReactDeploy). 

What it has is a in-built json database where I put all the data and fetch it from there to display it on my page. One can select product and add it to his/her basket and he/she will be notified howmany items selected. The program has CRUD functionality. I used React Router to navigate from one page to another. I used useNavigate and Link from React-Router-Dom interchangably. I tried to apply decouplying as much as I can, each functionality is separated and put in it's own component/page. Next step, I want to improve the deployment; it shows empty page unitl we cliced on the logo it shows no product. Besides, it has very minimalist design, so, it is to be improved as well in the future. 

Run the command 'npm run dev' to start.
